The [examples](./examples/) folder contains the source code for replicating the three test cases. See [arXiv pre-print](XXX).

# Abstract
We propose a mixed finite element method for Cosserat materials that, after local elimination of the Cauchy and coupled stress by means of a suitable quadrature rule, consists of displacement and rotation variables defined as piece-wise constants. First-order convergence of the method is shown both theoretically and experimentally.
