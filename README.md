The [examples](./examples/) folder contains the source code for replicating the three test cases. See [arXiv pre-print](XXX).

# Abstract
We propose mixed finite element methods for Cosserat materials that use a suitable quadrature rule to eliminate the Cauchy and coupled stress, locally. The reduced system consists of only the displacement and rotation variables. Stability and linear convergence are shown both theoretically and experimentally.
